# Artefacta - Manage artefact downloads and patched upgrades

> artefacta, Latin, "the artefacts"

## Concept

- Builds are versioned by the commit hash they were built from.
- Builds are uploaded are `<version>.tar.zst` files
- Patches between builds are calculated using _bidiff_ and uploaded as `<from-version>-<to-version>.patch.zst`
- Builds and patches are mirrored locally
- Locally, a `current` symlink points at the currently used version (which might or might not be latest one)

## Planned usage

Eventually, `artefacta` will be a fast and self-contained CLI tool
that allows getting new revisions of archives as fast as possible.

Calling it like this:

[source,shell]  
----
artefacta /srv/artefacts/package-name/ s3://bucket/package-name install 09c851
----

will try and install the version identified by the (sub-)hash `09c851`.
If it succeeds, it will be available as `/srv/artefacts/package-name/lastest`.
