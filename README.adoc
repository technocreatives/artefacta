# Artefacta - Manage artefact downloads and patched upgrades

## Concept

- Builds are versioned by the commit hash they were built from.
- Builds are uploaded are `<version>.tar.zst` files
- Patches between builds are calculated using _bidiff_ and uploaded as `<from-version>-<to-version>.patch.zst`
